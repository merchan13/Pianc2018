            <p>
              YP-Com focus is encouraging YPs to get involved in the technical and networking aspects of PIANC. Opportunities in PIANC for Young Professionals include networking through meetings and events, experience on technical Working Groups, and education with technical visits and scholarship opportunities dedicated to YPs.

              <ul>
                <li>Networking Events at PIANC Conferences</li>
                <li>Technical Visits to Unique Navigation Infrastructure Works</li>
                <li>Participation on PIANC Technical Commissions & Working Groups</li>
